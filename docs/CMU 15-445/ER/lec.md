* `=== ---->` one to many
* `==== ------` many to many
* `<--->` one to one

* `relationship` 带属性. :  如 `takes` 上的 `grade`.

An **entity** is an object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects.

Entities have **attributes**

An **entity set** is a set of entities of the same type that share the same

properties.
