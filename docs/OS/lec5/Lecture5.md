## Segmentation 

### Segmentation Fault:
* Segementation -- In x86 architecture, memory is divided into segments, each with a base address and a limit.
* Segmentation Fault -- Caused by accessing memory that "does not belong to you" (e.g. trying to write to a read-only segment of memory).
* Segmentation -- Not fixed size, can grow or shrink as needed. 
  
* Still have External Fragmentation -- Segments are of varying sizes, so memory may not be used efficiently.
  * How to solve this? -- Paging
