* Question $p_x=i\bar{h}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$

?(12-17课程结束)

The wave function of a particular quantum state of the hydrogen atom can be labeled by a set of quantum numbers $(n, l, m_l)$.

* The corresponding energy only depends on the **principal quantum number** $n = 1,2,3,....$

* The **orbital quantum number** $l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1$ is a measure of the magnitude of the angular momentum of the quantum state. States with $l = 0, 1, 2, 3$ are called $s, p, d, f$ . 

* The **orbital magnetic quantum number**

  $ml =−l,−l+1,...,l−1,l$  is related to the space orientation of this angular momentum vector.

* Heuristically,$∆L_x,∆L_y$ involves $∆_z,∆p_z$, therefore cannot vanish due to the uncertainty principle. In other words, one cannot simultaneously measure any two components of $L$. However, one can simultaneously measure $L^2$ and $L_z$ .

* Quantized by $\bar{h}$

* We can measure definite values of a component $L_z$ along a chosen measurement axis(usally taken to be a z axis) as given by $L_z=m_l\bar{h}$ for $m_l=0,±1,±2,……±l$

* In general , if the electron has a definite value of $L_z$ it may not have definite values of $L_x$ and $L_y$

* This is a manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

* Therefore, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is also quantized

  $\mu_{orb}=|r|L=\frac{e}{2m}\sqrt{l(l+1)}\bar{h}$

  $\mu_{orb},z=\gamma L_z=-m_l\frac{e\bar{h}}{2m}=-m_l\mu_B$

​	Define the **Bohr magneton** $\mu_B=\frac{eh}{4\pi m}=\frac{e\bar{h}}{2m}=9.274*10^{-24}J/T$

## Dynamics in a Uniform Magnetic Field

 An external magnetic field B⃗ will rotate a magnetic dipole moment μ⃗ with a total torque $\vec{\tau}=\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}$ , or, for an electron with orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ , $\vec{\tau}=\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}=\gamma\vec{L}\times\vec{B}$

## The Stern-Gerlach Experiment

In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, a narrow beam of silver atoms passes through an electromagnet (with a nonuniform magnetic field) and then lands on a glass detector plate.

* In the old quantum theory by Bohr (and Sommerfeld)

  An atom in a state with angular momentum equal to one $(L = 1)$ would have a magnetic moment with two components relative to the direction of the magnetic field.

  In this case the spot on the receiving plate will therefore be split into two, each of them having the same size but half the intensity of the original spot.

* In (Then) New Quantum Theory

  The later, or new, quantum theory developed by Heisenberg, Schroedinger, and others, predicted that for an $L = 1$ state the beam should split into three components.

In fact, we now know that a silver atom consists of many electrons ([Kr]4d105s1).

We also know that all those magnetic moments vectorially cancel out except for a single electron $(5s1)$, and the orbital dipole moment of that electron is zero.

Therefore, the Stern-Gerlach result posed a serious problem for the new quantum theory.

This was solved when Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (1925, 1926) proposed that the electron had an **intrinsic angular momentum**, not associated with its orbital motion. 

## Spin

The Stern-Gerlach experiment belongs to a class of quantum phenomena involving a quantum degree of freedom called **spin**, which has no classical counterpart.

Fortunately, one can describe spin and its dynamics without appealing to any mechanical model (such as that of a spinning top), starting with just the observed fact that it is a form of angular momentum.

### Electron Spin

Every electron, whether trapped in an atom or free, has a **spin angular momentum** and a **spin magnetic dipole moment** that are as **intrinsic** as its mass and charge. The existence of electron spin was postulated on experimental evidence by George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit from their studies of atomic spectra.

For every electron, $spin s = 1/2$ and the electron is said to be a $spin-1/2$ particle. (Protons and neutrons are also $spin-1/2$ particles.)

As with the angular momentum associated with motion, spin angular momentum can have a definite magnitude but does not have a definite **direction**.

The best we can do is to measure its component along the $z$ axis (or along any axis), and that component can have only the definite values given by $S_z =m_s\bar{h}, for\ m_s =±s=±1/2$.

Here $m_s$ is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can have only two values: $m_s = +s = +1/2$ (the electron is said to be **spin up**) and $m_s = −s = −1/2$ (the electron is said to be **spin down**).

* The electron is not spinning
* As with the orbital angular momentum, a magnetic dipole moment is associated with the spin angular momentum. Let us write $\vec{\mu}_s = g γ\vec{S}$ where $γ = −e/(2m)$ and the constant g is referred to as the $g-factor$.
* It turns out that the spin angular momentum generates a magnetic moment twice as large as the orbital angular momentum does, i.e. **g = 2.**
